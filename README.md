## Project Structure

The project has the following directory structure:

- `pages/`: This directory contains the pages of your application. Each `.ts` or `.tsx` file inside this directory represents a page.
- `public/`: This directory is used to serve static assets like images, fonts, and other files that don't need processing.
- `styles/`: Contains stylesheets for your application.
- `components/`: This directory contains reusable React components used across different pages.

## Building for Production

To build the project for production, use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

The optimized and minified files will be placed in the `.next/` directory.

## Deployment

You can deploy your Next.js application using platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or your own hosting solution. Follow their documentation for deployment instructions.
